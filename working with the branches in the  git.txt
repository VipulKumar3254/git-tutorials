if you wants to make the new branch in the git you can use the command :
    git checkout -b <name of the branch>

 to delete the git repository:
    rm -rf .git

in the branching structure files that are ingonred in the .ignore file will be considered as ingonred once.
means no effect will happen on them.

if you moves them or deletes it will not make too much effect(no effect)

to view the current branch:
    git branch (this command will tell you all the branches in the git)

    current working branch will be highlighted.
    

    just making the branch:
    git branch <name of the branch>
