to make the file match with the last  commit because you have modified the content of the file accidently so you can use the command :

git checkout -- <name of the file>

and that command is tested by me personally.

git checkout -f is the command that can be used to do the files (all) at the stage of the last commit.

How to unstage the files in git that you have staged by mistake:

git restore --staged <name of the file>
